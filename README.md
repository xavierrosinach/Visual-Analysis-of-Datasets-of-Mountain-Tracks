# Visual-Analysis-of-Datasets-of-Mountain-Tracks

The goal of the project is the creation of an interactive application that facilitates the exploration of hiking tracks across mountains. The dataset contains multiple tracks that consist on tracks (sets of positions with timestamps) that have been gathered. The objective would be to create a tool that analyzes those tracks in the context of an Open Street Map background.
